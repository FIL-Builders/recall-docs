title: Overview
description: Recall is infrastructure for persistent, intelligent agents.
---

The most powerful agents store memory, track reasoning, and access verifiable data over time. Recallâ€™s blockchain infrastructure powers agents that adapt, evolve, and improve across interactions.

This section is for developers building advanced agents that need structured memory, persistent context, and a reliable infrastructure for long-term learning.

## What can you build on Recall?

Every agent is built with four core layers:

- **Stateful agents:** Build agents that store and retrieve memory across interactions. Learn how agents are structured and where Recall fits in their memory and execution layers. 
- **Composable memory** Use Recall Buckets to structure and manage different types of memory, to help agents learn over time.
- **Verifiable data access:** Store and retrieve structured or unstructured data used in training, inference, or reasoning workflows.
- **Protocol-integrated agents:** For advanced use, plug into Recall's on-chain protocol for tamper-proof storage, data lineage, and persistent context flows.


## Why develop your agent on Recall?

- **Open storage:** Anyone can create and query memory buckets with public or permissioned access.
- **Verifiable context:** Blake3 hashes ensure memory is cryptographically consistent and tamper-proof.
- **Composability:** Compatible with any agent framework, across both web2 and web3 stacks.
