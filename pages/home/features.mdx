## Features

Hoku is designed to break down data barriers and enable new data-driven applications by addressing the following:

- **Demand side of data**: Hoku is for developers, organizations, and machines who wish to _gain access to data and
  request data transformations_ in exchange for a fee (e.g., AI).
- **Supply side of data**: Hoku is for data _and_ infrastructure providers who wish to _store data_, and eventually
  _provide access to_ and _transform data_ for monetization purposes (e.g., DePIN).
- **Security and infra providers**: Hoku is for general participants interested in helping to _ensure access_ to the
  world’s data (e.g., node operators).

### Flexible, programmable VM / execution

- The Hoku chain supports a blended _native_ VM / execution environment for programming and running onchain data
  products using either of the below, while maintaining full composability:

  - Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) in Rust for high performance computing.
  - Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in Solidity for simpler, more familiar web3 framework.

- By supporting both the EVM and FVM, Hoku brings the best of both worlds together and gives the large cohort of
  existing Ethereum developers the ability to, for the first time, utilize the same data and storage primitives as FVM
  developers.

### Lightening-fast settlement & consensus

- A **hierarchical subnet architecture** and layered consensus model that enables scalable, cost-effective storage and
  compute, competitive with traditional cloud providers.
- Offchain service integrations, like Ceramic and Basin, allow **offchain data to be settled onchain** in an efficient
  manner and with **consensus over data state**.

### Native Data Availability

- Hoku introduces a new _data overlay_ service that is custom built for use cases revolving around **storing and
  managing large files with high throughput** in a decentralized fashion.
- It's a system for permissionlessly storing and serving data that powers products and workflows within the ecosystem,
  removing the need for centralized hosting and storage middleware.
- It guarantees high availability of data, allowing customers to access their data at any time without significant
  downtime.

### Network-level access control

- Sophisticated **access control mechanisms** that don’t rely solely on encryption to protect data.
- Fine-grained access to subsets of data on a per-application basis—giving developers the interoperability and
  portability enabled by decentralization without sacrificing privacy.
- Physical-access control can be further combined with the advanced encryption and zero-knowledge techniques being
  developed across the crypto ecosystem to provide a level of security thus far unseen in the web3 space.

## Services

At launch, there are four primary offerings available:

- **Basin**: Object storage with S3-compatability.
- **Ceramic**: Edge data sourcing and storage.
- **OrbisDB**: SQL database for application builders.
- **Tableland**: Onchain SQL database for EVM-driven data.

You can learn more about each of these and how to use them throughout this documentation.

## Limits

There are a few limitations to be aware of when building on Hoku. Keep in mind that services like Basin and Ceramic have
their own constraints, which are detailed in their respective sections.

- **Maximum data size**: 1 GiB (arbitrary constraint during testnet phase).
- **Throughput (TPS)**: Hundreds of transactions per second.

Note: TPS is rough estimate and may vary based on network conditions. The node design is still under heavy development,
optimizations are being made, and benchmarked tests are yet to be finalized.
