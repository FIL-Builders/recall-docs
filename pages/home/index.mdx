    Hoku is _the_ collaborative cloudâ€”a decentralized network built to solve problems for data-hungry applications and users (e.g., DePINs, ML workloads, AI agents) and move beyond static datasets by providing continuously updated data sinks.

    Powered by a general purpose *data overlay* protocol, anyone can openly spawn and use core services to help store, manage, expose, and consume data through flexible interfaces:

    - **Basin**: Enhanced object storage for simple & scalable data.
    - **Ceramic**: Edge data synchronization & storage, along with privacy features.
    - **Databases**: Query engines on top of the core services, including OrbisDB & Tableland.
