## Overview

Basin's object storage takes advantage of the ADM's subnet scaling infrastructure to enable fast and cost-effective storage of large amounts of data. Basin's usage pattern generally consists of two components:

- Creating an object store (with certain permissions on who can write data).
- Adding, listing, getting, and deleting objects.

These key-value stores allow you to push and retrieve data in a familiar S3-like fashion. They support byte range requests and advanced queries based on key prefix, delimiter, offset, and limit. Internally, the state of an object store is represented as an [IPLD-based HAMT](https://ipld.io/specs/advanced-data-layouts/hamt/spec/) (hash array mapped trie); the IPLD data model provides a flexible and extensible way to represent complex data structures.

## Implementation

### Smart contract

The interface is implemented as a smart contract that is deployed on a subnet. Data is represented as an onchain CID within a contract state, and the _actual_ data is stored offchain in a node's local (networked) block store. Spawning new object stores is handled with a general factory smart contract, which the various Basin interfaces (SDK, CLI) call under the hood.

### Detached payloads

Basin uses the concept of a _detached payload_ asynchronous sync mechanism, which is a transaction that includes a CID reference to an object, but does not include the object data itself. When a detached payload is added to the chain, validators are required to download the object data from the network and verify that it matches the CID reference. This ensures that all validators have a copy of the object data and can verify the integrity of the object store state.

## Accounts & addresses

### EVM compatibility

Accounts (ECDSA, secp256k1) are used to send data-carrying transactions as you would on any blockchain system. Thus, all mutations are onchain transactions within a subnet, so funds are required to pay for writes. Since Basin is built on top of Filecoin's FVM, the addresses can follow a _slightly_ different convention than a purely EVM-based account system.

Generally, you can use EVM-style (i.e., `0x` prefixed) accounts for user operations (writes, etc.), but an object storage _contract_ is represented as an FVM-style address. This is being further researched to create a consistent experience.

### FVM compatibility

Here's a quick primer on how Filecoin addresses work:

- Addresses are prefixed with a network identifier: `t` for Filecoin testnet, or `f` for Filecoin mainnet, and there are five different address types denoted by the second character in the address string: `t0`/`f0` to `t4`/`f4`.
- If you're coming from the EVM world, you'll mostly see two types in the ADM:
  - `t2`/`f2`: Any FVM-native contract that gets deployed, such as the object store and accumlator machines.
  - `t4`/`f4`: A namespaced contract address, and `t410`/`f410` is a specifalized namespace for Ethereum-compatible addresses (wallets _and_ smart contracts) on the FVM.
- Namely, each `t410...`/`f410...` address is equivalent to a `0x` address; the hex address is [encoded in the FVM address string](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/filecoin-evm-runtime/address-types#converting-to-a-0x-style-address).

Once your EVM-style account is registered on a subnet, the `0x` and its corresponding `t410...`/`f410...` addresses can be used interchangeably on Basin subnets.

## Access control

Currently, there are two types of write-access controls: only-owner or public access. For example, you can create an object store that you, and _only_ you, can write to—gated by signatures from your private key. Or, you can have "allow all" access where anyone can write data.

This is being further refined, and there will be more robust access control mechanisms soon.

## Broadcast modes

There are three ways in which transactions can be broadcasted to the network: `commit`, `sync`, and `async`. Here's a quick overview of each:

- `commit`: Wait until the transaction is delivered and final (default behavior).
- `sync`: Wait only for the result of a local transaction pre-check, but don’t wait for it to be delivered to all validators (i.e., added risk the transaction may fail during delivery).
- `async`: Does not wait at all. You will not see errors in your terminal (i.e., added risk the transaction may fail during delivery).

## Chain RPCs & funds

Since Basin is built on top of Filecoin, you must have FIL in your account to interact with the network. The ADM is currently only live on the Filecoin Calibration network, so you can get tFIL via the faucet [here](https://faucet.calibnet.chainsafe-fil.io/funds.html). For reference, Filecoin chain information can be found [here](https://chainlist.org/?search=filecoin&testnets=true).

## Limits

There are a few limitations and behaviors imposed by the current testnet implementation:

- The maximum size for a single object is 1 GiB.
- All objects are stored as "detached" payloads offchain and resolved as a CID.
- Current throughput is hundreds of transactions per second (TPS)
  - Note: this is a rough estimate and may vary based on network conditions. The node design is still under heavy development, and optimizations are being made.
