<Steps>

### Installation

You'll need to download the source code, build, and install the CLI.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hokunet/rust-hoku.git
cd rust-hoku
make install
```

Once installed, you can run the `hoku` command from your terminal.

```sh
hoku --help
```

### Configuration

There are two flags required for the majority of the `hoku` subcommands:

- `--network`: Specify the chain location with RPC presets and settings that map to either `mainnet`
  (not available), `ignition` (default),`testnet`, `localnet`, or `devnet`.
- `--private-key`: A wallet private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for signing transactions.

As a best practice, you should create a `.env` file with the following and run `source .env` to
ensure the commands load these variables. The default network is `ignition`, so it's not necessary
to set the network variable unless you're developing elsewhere (e.g., local development uses
`localnet`).

```txt filename=".env"
HOKU_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
HOKU_NETWORK=ignition
```
