## CID

A [CID](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) is short for _Content Identifier_, which is a self-describing, content-addressed, and immutable hash determined by the contents itself. For example, a CID might look something like `bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`.

## Detached payload

A piece of data that is stored in Basin with an asynchronous sync mechanism, which is a transaction that includes a CID reference to an object, but does not include the object data itself.
