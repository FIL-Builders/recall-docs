The Hoku SDK is a Rust library that provides a simple interface for interacting with the Hoku buckets object storage
system. It is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to build applications that interact with buckets in
a variety of ways.

There are two primary crates that are used in tandem with the Hoku SDK crate. All three _may_ be required, depending on
the use case, so let's break down what each crate does:

- `hoku_provider`: Provides the means to interact with the buckets object storage system via a chain and object
  provider.
- `hoku_signer`: A transaction signer to help manage sending transactions to the subnet.
- `hoku_sdk`: The Hoku SDK itself, which provides a simple interface for interacting with Hoku and uses the other two
  crates to do so.

## Installation

To use the Hoku SDK in your Rust project, add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
hoku_provider = { git = "https://github.com/hokunet/rust-hoku.git" }
hoku_sdk = { git = "https://github.com/hokunet/rust-hoku.git" }
hoku_signer = { git = "https://github.com/hokunet/rust-hoku.git" }
```

Be sure to replace the revision hash with the latest version in the repo for the most up-to-date code!

## Additional dependencies

For the sake of these examples, you'll also want to make sure you add the following to you `Cargo.toml`. The
`fendermint_actor_machine` will later be used to define the write options for the object store (e.g., only owner can
write, etc.), so this is most likely something you'll want to include.

```toml
fendermint_actor_machine = { git = "https://github.com/hokunet/ipc.git", rev = "9775e566800413314f6d7f6e6c2176a20c9120bd" }
```

We'll also use the following, which are common for handling asynchronous network operations:

- `tokio`: Async file operations.
- `async-tempfile`: Create async temporary files when adding or getting objects.

```toml
async-tempfile = "0.6.0"
tokio = { version = "1.37.0", features = ["fs", "macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```
