import { Callout, Steps } from "nextra/components";

The Basin faucet is a free service that drips subnet-bridged tHOKU and helps reduce the waiting
period for new accounts to use Basin.

<Callout type="info">

The faucet is **not** enabled, yet. We'll announce once it's live, but for now, reach out to the
team to get testnet funds.

</Callout>

<Steps>

### Faucet sign in

First, head to faucet at: [https://faucet.hoku.sh](https://faucet.hoku.sh). Then, click the GitHub
login button, which will redirect you to sign in with your GitHub account.

### Request funds

Once connected, you'll be able to input your wallet address and request funds.

### Wait for funds

After requesting funds, you'll have to wait for them to be deposited into your wallet. This should
only take a few seconds and will log the successful transaction hash once it's good to go.

### Start building

Now that you have funds in your wallet, you're all set to start building on Basin! Be sure to use
the same private key you used to sign up for the faucet when you use tools like the Studio, CLI, or
any other Hoku tooling.
