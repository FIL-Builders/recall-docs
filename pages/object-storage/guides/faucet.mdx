title: Faucet
description: Request subnet testnet funds to get started with Basin development.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

The Basin faucet is a free service that drips subnet-bridged tFIL and helps reduce the waiting period for new accounts
to use Basin.

<Callout type="info">

The faucet is **not** enabled, yet. We'll announce once it's live, but for now, head to the
[public Filecoin Calibration faucet](https://faucet.calibnet.chainsafe-fil.io) and then use the CLI to `deposit` the
funds into your wallet on the subnet.
