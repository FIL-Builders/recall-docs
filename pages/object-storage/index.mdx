## Object storage

Basin is a simple, scalable, and onchain object storage service on top of the core ADM network. It is a high-throughput data layer, powered by subnets on the Filecoin network, that allows you to store large amounts of data with fast finality and retrieval timesâ€”all at a low cost and with full S3 compatibility!

- **Verifiable data**: Cryptographic security guarantees your data remains tamper-proof and authentic, fostering trust and transparency.
- **Data Availability**: High-throughput, S3-compatible architecture ensures your data is always accessible when you need it with cryptographic proofs.
- **Cost effective**: Pay only for what you use with Basin's competitive on-chain pricing model, seamlessly scaling your storage needs as you grow.
- **Advanced collaboration**: Enhance collaboration with programmable rules for data sharing and access that can be tailored to your specific needs.
