title: CometBFT API
description: Endpoints for interacting with the Hoku network's CometBFT API.
---

Hoku's consensus layer is built with CometBFT (v0.37). Currently, there is no directly exposed
execution RPC. Instead, all calls flow through this layerâ€”including the EVM RPCs, which are proxied
to CometBFT before being sent to the Wasm/EVM runtime.

## Base URL

The CometBFT API endpoints for each of the Hoku chain environments are listed below:

- `ignition` (testnet): `https://api-ignition-0.hoku.sh`
- `localnet` or `devnet`: `http://127.0.0.1:26657`

## Endpoints

You can review all of the supported endpoints in the
[CometBFT API documentation](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/rpc/).

<Callout type="info">

This page is a work in progress. It's unlikely you'll interact with these API directly since this
logic is predominately handled in the core Rust logic, and the EVM RPCs help expose this information
as well. However, we'll add more information about how to directly make calls to CometBFT in the
future.
