import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

You can find all of the Ignition testnet information below, such as contract addresses and chain
information.

<Callout type="warning"  >

The Hoku network is still under development, so these values are **heavily** subject to change. The
testnet will be upgraded every ~2 weeks, and each upgrade will change the subnet ID, chain ID, and
certain contract addresses.

</Callout>

## Ignition (testnet)

### Chain & subnet ID

| Description | Value                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Subnet ID   | `/r314159/t410f3oewkcvacaaydfn4v6diulzise26cpfolfj7heq` |

The corresponding chain ID for this subnet ID is the following:

- Integer: `3258443211374980`
- Hex: `0xb93896e228184`

Note the subnet ID can be converted to its integer value by taking the
[FNV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function) hash (64 bit) of
the subnet ID string representation, modulo the maximum chain ID value (`4503599627370476`, as
defined in [EIP-2294](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2294)).

### Contracts

#### Core

| Description                | Address                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Subnet EVM gateway         | `0x77aa40b105843728088c0132e43fc44348881da8` |
| Subnet EVM registry        | `0x74539671a1d2f1c8f200826baba665179f53a1b7` |
| Subnet EVM validator gater | `0x2c6f90127a2487aC6524Cf93e796971478432447` |
| Parent EVM gateway         | `0xF8Abf46A1114d3B44d18F2A96D850e36FC6Ee94E` |
| Parent EVM registry        | `0x0bb143a180b61ae6b1872bbf99dBe261A2aDde40` |
| Parent EVM supply source   | `0x20d8a696091153c4d4816ba1fdefe113f71e0905` |

Note that the subnet contracts will always be the same for any new subnet deployed. The parent
contracts may change, up until the testnet is stabilized.

#### Solidity wrappers

The Solidity wrappers are libraries that facilitate making calls to the Wasm runtime. Anyone can
deploy them, but the following addresses are the ones that are officially supported:

| Description    | Address                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Bucket manager | `0xd5E54fe1b8eC9bf73Fdc195Ee2399c97B1a37B8E` |
| Credit manager | `0xB2a4636b743EBdF13Bb83a8F4c520c965131d294` |

## Localnet

### Chain & subnet ID

Since localnet is a deterministic local-only development network, the subnet ID and chain ID will
always be the same.

| Description | Value                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Subnet ID   | `/r314159/t410fkzrz3mlkyufisiuae3scumllgalzuu3wxlxa2ly` |

The corresponding chain ID for this subnet ID is the following:

- Integer: `4362550583360910`
- Hex: `0xf7fb775d5fd8e`

### Contracts

#### Core

| Description                | Address                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Subnet EVM gateway         | `0x77aa40b105843728088c0132e43fc44348881da8` |
| Subnet EVM registry        | `0x74539671a1d2f1c8f200826baba665179f53a1b7` |
| Subnet EVM validator gater | `0x851356ae760d987E095750cCeb3bC6014560891C` |
| Parent EVM gateway         | `0x77aa40b105843728088c0132e43fc44348881da8` |
| Parent EVM registry        | `0x74539671a1d2f1c8f200826baba665179f53a1b7` |
| Parent EVM supply source   | `0xE6E340D132b5f46d1e472DebcD681B2aBc16e57E` |

#### Solidity wrappers

| Description    | Address                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Bucket manager | `0xd5E54fe1b8eC9bf73Fdc195Ee2399c97B1a37B8E` |
| Credit manager | `0xB2a4636b743EBdF13Bb83a8F4c520c965131d294` |

## Devnet

Since devnet is also a deterministic local-only development network, the subnet ID and chain ID will
always be the same. It differs from the localnet in that it doesn't have the concept of a "parent"
chain and is meant for testing core protocol changes.

### Chain & subnet ID

| Description | Value  |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Subnet ID   | `test` |

The corresponding chain ID for this subnet ID is the following:

- Integer: `1942764459484029`
- Hex: `0x6e6ef197d637d`

### Contracts

The devnet does not deploy contracts. You'll have to run the devnet's built-in EVM API feature and
deploy all contracts yourself.
