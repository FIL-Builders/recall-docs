The Hoku SDK is a Rust library that provides a simple interface for interacting with Hoku buckets.
It is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to build applications that interact with
buckets in a variety of ways.

There are two primary crates that are used in tandem with the Hoku SDK crate. All three _may_ be
required, depending on the use case, so let's break down what each crate does:

- `hoku_provider`: Provides the means to interact with the bucket storage system via a chain and
  object provider.
- `hoku_signer`: A transaction signer to help manage sending transactions to the subnet.
- `hoku_sdk`: The Hoku SDK itself, which provides a simple interface for interacting with Hoku and
  uses the other two crates to do so.

## Installation

To use the Hoku SDK in your Rust project, add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
hoku_provider = { git = "https://github.com/hokunet/rust-hoku.git" }
hoku_sdk = { git = "https://github.com/hokunet/rust-hoku.git" }
hoku_signer = { git = "https://github.com/hokunet/rust-hoku.git" }
```

Be sure to replace the revision hash with the latest version in the repo for the most up-to-date
code!

## Additional dependencies

For the sake of these examples, you'll also want to make sure you add the following to you
`Cargo.toml`. The `fendermint_actor_machine` will later be used to define the write options for the
object store (e.g., only owner can write, etc.), so this is most likely something you'll want to
include. The specific revision hash should match what's defined in the `rust-hoku` repo's
`Cargo.toml` file
[here](https://github.com/hokunet/rust-hoku/blob/d442dbe7152717191af7912da7473e4fcacf95e5/Cargo.toml#L77).

```toml
fendermint_actor_machine = { git = "https://github.com/hokunet/ipc.git", rev = "139782cff4edec919d021c31400661d4cb3ff946" }
```

We'll also use the following, which are common for handling asynchronous network operations:

- `tokio`: Async file operations.
- `async-tempfile`: Create async temporary files when adding or getting objects.

```toml
async-tempfile = "0.6.0"
tokio = { version = "1.37.0", features = ["fs", "macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```
