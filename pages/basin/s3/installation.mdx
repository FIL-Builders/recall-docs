description: Use existing S3 tooling alongside the Basin S3 adapter.

import { Callout, Steps } from "nextra/components";

The `basin_s3` binary is a simple adapter that allows you to use the Basin object storage system
with S3-compatibility. Let's walk through how to set it up, and subsequent pages walk through how to
use it with ancillary tools S3 like MinIO.

### Setup

<Steps>
  
### Install

First, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hokunet/basin-s3
```

Then, `cd` into `basin-s3` and install the adapter binary:

```sh
make install
```

This should make `basin_s3` available in your path, which you can verify with `basin_s3 --version`.

### Run the adapter

Starting the Basin S3 adapter uses port `8014` by default. There are three required flags:

- `--private-key`: Hex encoded, Ethereum-style private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for sending
  transactions (environment variable: `PRIVATE_KEY`).
- `--network`: The network to connect to (environment variable: `NETWORK`).
- `--access-key`: An S3 access key (e.g,. `AKEXAMPLES3S`)
- `--secret-key`: An S3 secret key (e.g., `SKEXAMPLES3S`)

```sh
basin_s3 --private-key [your_private_key] --access-key AKEXAMPLES3S --secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S
```

The access key and secret aren't used for anything other than matching the MinIO client
configuration. If you want to do read-only queries, simply omit the private key. Alternatvely, you
can run it directly with `cargo run`:

```sh
cargo run --features binary -- --private-key [your_private_key] --access-key AKEXAMPLES3S --secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S
```

<Callout type="info">

If you do not already have a private key, you can generate one with the Hoku CLI. You also _must_
make sure your account exists on the subnet, which requires you have deposited funds into your
subnet account. Neglecting this step will lead to errors like
`failed to init sequence; actor ... cannot be found`.

</Callout>

</Steps>

## Next steps

You can now use Basin with any S3-compatible tooling! The example below walks through how to use it
with an S3-compatible CLI tool like MinIO, which is demonstrated in the ensuing page. But, its
compatibility extends to any S3-compatible client or library (e.g.,
[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/), etc.).
