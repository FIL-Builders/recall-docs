# Getting started

OrbisDB SDK is an [open-source](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk) Typescript module available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@useorbis/db-sdk).

## Installation

You can install OrbisDB SDK with any package manager that supports the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@useorbis/db-sdk)

```bash
npm install @useorbis/db-sdk
```

## Initialize the SDK

OrbisDB requires some basic configuration to work, mainly Ceramic and OrbisDB node gateways.\
There's a slight difference based on the type of an instance you're connecting to.\
Learn more about instance types [here](https://www.notion.so/Overview-fbc65a9a0356485a993b0cab190779f3?pvs=21) (link).

### Dedicated instance

> When running OrbisDB and Ceramic locally, your gateways are\
**Ceramic** - `http://localhost:7007`\
**OrbisDB** - `http://localhost:7008`
> 

> If you're not self-hosting the instance, your information should be made available by your provider.
> 

```tsx
import { OrbisDB } from "@useorbis/db-sdk"

const db = new OrbisDB({
    ceramic: {
        gateway: "YOUR_CERAMIC_NODE_URL"
    },
    nodes: [
        {
            gateway: "YOUR_ORBIS_NODE_URL"
        }
    ]
})
```

### Shared instance

When using a shared instance, such as OrbisDB Studio (link), you must provide an environment to connect to.

#### Environments

Shared OrbisDB instances are multi-tenant nodes that can host multiple, isolated, projects on a single node.\
All environments share the same underlying hardware, network and Ceramic node, but are logically separate with isolated databases, admins and configurations.

> You can find your [OrbisDB Studio](https://www.notion.so/Managed-Studio-be33efc2124e4f3583ab10a1639c45b1?pvs=21) (link) gateways on the home (Contexts) page.\
> If you're using a 3rd party provider, they should provide the information.

```tsx
import { OrbisDB } from "@useorbis/db-sdk"

const db = new OrbisDB({
    ceramic: {
        gateway: "YOUR_CERAMIC_NODE_URL"
    },
    nodes: [
        {
            gateway: "YOUR_ORBIS_NODE_URL",
            env: "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID"
        }
    ]
})
```
