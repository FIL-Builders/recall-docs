A list of resources to get you started with decentralized data today.

# OrbisDB `Studio`

OrbisDB Studio is a shared node managed by the team behind OrbisDB. 
You can start exploring OrbisDB with no downloads, setup or a single line of code.

Check out our [Managed section](https://www.notion.so/Managed-Studio-be33efc2124e4f3583ab10a1639c45b1?pvs=21) (link) or [**visit the Studio**](https://studio.useorbis.com/).

# OrbisDB `Node`

You can find the source code of OrbisDB nodes [**in our Github**](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/orbisdb). It’s MIT licensed.

Learn how to set up your node for local development or in the cloud in our [Setting up section](https://www.notion.so/Overview-fbc65a9a0356485a993b0cab190779f3?pvs=21) (link).

# OrbisDB `Dashboard`

# OrbisDB `SDK`

In order to read and write data programmatically, you need an SDK. 
Check out the [**source code**](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk) or the [**package**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@useorbis/db-sdk) and install it using your favorite package manager.

Quickstart your decentralized data journey with our [SDK Reference](https://www.notion.so/Getting-started-12a929384dd644fd9618b2d8e62ddda9?pvs=21) (link).

## Installing the SDK

You can use your package manager of choice, in this case we’ll be using NPM.

```bash
npm install @useorbis/db-sdk
```
